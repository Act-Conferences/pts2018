<h2>Coming to Lyon</h2>

  <h3>By plane</h3>

  <p>The airport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon-Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry_Airport">Lyon Saint-Exupéry</a> (LYS).<p>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhone_express">Rhônexpress</a>
  shuttle from the airport makes for an easy ride to the Part-Dieu station
  (the stop is right between the train station and the hotel). Shuttles
  depart every 15 minutes, and the ride takes less than 30 minutes and
  costs €15.90 for a single and €75.50 for a return ticket.
  You can buy tickets in advance at the <a href="http://www.rhonexpress.fr/">official website</a>,
  at the vending machines in the station, or even in the shuttle itself (but with an extra charge).</p>
  <p>A taxi to Part-Dieu would cost about €50, for about the same transit time,
  so it's only really worth it if there are 3 or 4 people sharing the ride.</p>

  <h3>By train</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon-Part-Dieu">Lyon Part-Dieu</a> train station is literaly across the street from the hotel.</p>
  <p>The train station has two exits: make sure you exit on the side of platform K. You should see the hotel across the tram lines and the car park from the station.</p>

  <h3>Public transport</h3>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transports_en_commun_lyonnais">Lyon has a dense public transport network</a> consisting of bus, trolleybus, tram, and metro. For most of the hackathon-related commutes, everything should be in walking distance.
