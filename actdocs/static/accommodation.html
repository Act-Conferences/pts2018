<h2>Traveling to Oslo</h2>

  <h3>By plane</h3>

  <p>The airport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo-Gardermoen_Airport">Oslo Airport, Gardermoen</a> (OSL). Some low-cost carriers (e.g. Ryanair) also use the Torp Airport (TRF), but we don't recommend using this option unless your savings are substantial and you have lots of time.<p>

  <p>The <a href="">Oslo Airport Express train</a> from the airport makes for an easy ride to the Oslo Central station. Trains depart every 10 minutes, and the ride takes less than 30 minutes and costs NOK 180.00 (€18). There are also regular scheduled trains (not Express).</p>

  <p> You can buy tickets at the vending machines both at the airport and the Oslo Central station.</p>

  <p>A taxi to Oslo would cost about NOK 800, for about the same transit time, so it's only really worth it if there are 3 or 4 people sharing the ride.</p>

  <h3>By train</h3>
  <p>The are several international train services to <a href="">Oslo Central Station</a>, primarily from Sweden and Denmark. Train services to/from the rest of Europe go through Copenhagen.</p>

  <p>In general, traveling to Norway by train is workable, but we don't recommend it unless you travel within Scandinavia (e.g. from Gothenburg, Stockholm or the Malmö/Copenhagen area).</p>

  <h3>Public transport</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.visitoslo.com/en/transport/in-oslo/"></a>Oslo has an excellent public transport system</a> with trams, buses, train, ferries and a metro. For most of the summit-related commutes, everything should be in walking distance.  </p>
